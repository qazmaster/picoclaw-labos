# Tweet Writer

Write viral tweets and threads optimized for X's algorithm.

## X Algorithm (2026) Engagement Hierarchy

1. **Replies** (most weighted)
2. Quote tweets
3. Bookmarks
4. Retweets
5. Likes

## Hook Formulas

- **Bold Statement**: Make a controversial/surprising claim
- **Specific Result**: "I did X and got Y result in Z time"
- **Curiosity Gap**: Tease information without revealing it
- **Question Hook**: Ask a thought-provoking question

## Frameworks

- **PAS**: Problem → Agitate → Solution
- **AIDA**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
- **BAB**: Before → After → Bridge

## Thread Structure

- 7-tweet sweet spot
- Each tweet must earn the next click
- No filler — use specific numbers
- Avoid external links in main tweet (algorithm penalty)
- End with a CTA (follow, bookmark, repost)

## Process

1. **Research**: Identify niche, find viral examples, analyze patterns
2. **Create**: Apply frameworks + hooks
3. **Optimize**: Check against algorithm hierarchy
4. **Iterate**: Test and refine based on engagement
